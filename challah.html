  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <h6>1. In stand mixer, combine warm water, yeast and sugar. Allow to rest for five minutes.<br><br>2. Add 1/2 cup bread flour, salt, butter, 3 whole eggs and 2 egg yolks to stand mixer. Combine on low speed until well-mixed.<br><br>3. With the mixer on low speed, add flour one half-cup at a time, scraping the edges of the bowl as necessary. Mix until dough comes together as one ball.<br><br>4. Cover stand-mixer bowl with tea towel and allow to rest for 15-20 minutes.<br><br>5. Remove tea towel. Knead dough by hand or on low speed for 9-10 minutes, until dough is smooth and slightly shiny.<br><br>6. Form dough into a ball by folding corners into the center, then rolling the seam on the countertop. The dough sticking to the counter will help complete the sphere.<br><br>7. Roll dough in greased mixing bowl on all sides. Place dough in bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Top with tea towel and allow to proof in a warm (75-85 degrees) place until doubled in size, 60 to 90 minutes.<br><br>8. Remove dough from bowl. Knead dough once more, for about 1-2 minutes, and replace dough in bowl. Cover again with plastic wrap & tea towel and place in the refrigerator for at least 3 and up to 18 hours.<br><br>9. Remove dough from refrigeration. Using food scale for accuracy, measure out 7 (for fishtail braid) or 8 (for plaited loaf braid) equal pieces. Form into balls and cover on the counter for 15-20 minutes.<br><br>10. Once dough is closer to room temperature, roll each ball into even length 'snakes'. Use the entire length of both hands to help keep an even thickness throughout the length of each 'snake'. You will likely need to re-roll each piece a bit to account for shrinkage. Ensuer that the ends of each piece come to a tapered point.<br><br>11. Preheat oven to 365 degrees. Prepare a parchment-paper lined baking sheet for your challah.<br><br>For Fishtail Braid (7 Strand):<br><br>1. Arrange your 7 'snakes' vertically in front of you. Place 4 on the left side and 3 on the right of center. Twist tips of all 7 pieces together and tuck underneath the strands.<br><br>2. Begin by taking the far outside left strand and taking it over the other three left side strands and placing it next to the furthest inside right strand. Keep the two groups separated to ensure even braid.<br><br>3. Continue by taking the furthest outside right strand, now the side with four strands, and placing it next to the furthest inside left strand.<br><br>4. Continue taking the furthest outside strand from the side with four strands over to the furthest inside strand of the side with 3 strands. When you reach the end of the loaf and the strands are too short to bring over to the proper position, tightly tuck the strands up underneath the end of the loaf.<br><br>5. Use your hands to shape the loaf into an even rectangular/oval shape. Whisk the last egg and use the pastry brush to completely coat the outside of the challah.",  "6. Place the challah on the sheet tray and place in a warm place for 30-45 minutes. Brush again with egg wash and add sprinkle/topping if desired. Bake at 365 degrees for 30-35 minutes or bottom of bread makes a hollow sound when tapped.<br><br>7. Dry on a rack completely before serving.<br><br>For Plaited Loaf Style:<br><br>1. Arrange your 8 'snakes' & twist tips of all 8 pieces together and tuck underneath the strands.<br><br>2. For each step, you will count the strands as numbers 1-8 with 1 always being the furthest left strand and 8 being the furthest right strand. Pull each strand high and tight on the loaf for each step for the most visually appealing challah.<br><br>3. Begin by taking strand 8 under strand 7 and over strand 1. You will not repeat this step.<br><br>4. Take strand 8, the far right strand, over strand 5. Then, take strand 2 under strand 3 and up and over strand 8. Remember, take each strand high and tight for each step. Then, take strand 1 over strand 4. Finish the pattern by taking strand 7 under strand 6 and over strand 1.<br><br>5. Repeat the previous steps:<br><br>  Take strand 8 over strand 5.<br><br>    Take strand 2 under strand 3 and up and over strand 8.<br><br>  Take strand 1 over strand 4.<br><br>    Take strand 7 under strand 6 and over strand 1.<br><br>6. When you reach the end of the loaf and the strands are too short to bring over to the proper postion, tightly tuck the strands up underneath the end of the loaf.<br><br>7. Use your hands to shape the loaf into an even rectangular/oval shape. Whisk the last egg and use the pastry brush to completely coat the outside of the challah.<br><br>8. Place the challah on the sheet tray and place in a warm place for 30-45 minutes. Brush again with egg wash and add spinkle/topping if desired. Bake at 365 degrees for 30-35 minutes or bottom of bread makes a hollow sound when tapped.<br><br>9. Dry on a rack completely before serving.</h6>
