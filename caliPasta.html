  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <h6>Fill a large pot, about 8 quarts, with about 4 quarts of water. Place over high heat and salt generously.<br><br>2. While waiting for water to boil, finely chop one large shallot. Place 1/2 lb of asparagus on your cutting board. Trim the bottom 2 inches of the asparagus stalks. If the lighter colored section of the asparagus extends above this 2 inch point, cut so that remaining asparagus is uniformly colored. Dispose of trimmed ends.<br><br>3. Cut trimmed asparagus spears into 1/2 inch long pieces and set aside. Drain well 1 cup of jarred artichokes in oil, chop into 1/2 inch pieces.<br><br>4. Remove any shells and tails on 3/4 lb of shrimp. In a large skillet, pre-heat 2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil over medium high heat. Carefully add shallots to oil, season well with salt and pepper. Once shallot is transluscent, about 3 minutes, add asparagus and artichoke pieces. Stir with a rubber spatula and season with salt & pepper once more.<br><br>5. Once water in large pot has reached a rolling boil, add 1 lb of trottole pasta, stir well. Follow cooking time directions from pasta packaging, allowing pasta to boil with occasional stirring for low end of specified cooking time range.<br><br>6. Once asparagus and shallot pieces begin to brown around edges, deglaze pan with juice of 1 lemon and 4 oz of Sherry or Madeira cooking wine. Be carefully, the liquid may splatter a bit in the hot pan. Reduce heat to medium low and allow liquid to simmer for 8-10 minutes.<br><br>7. As soon as pasta reaches al dente, or is easy to bite through but still firm, remove pot from heat. Use cup measure to transfer 1 cup of pasta water to skillet containing shallot, asparagus, and artichoke mixture. Drain pasta in a large collander, do not rinse pasta. Bring mixture in skillet to a boil over high heat.<br><br>8. Once liquid in skillet is boiling, remove skillet from heat and add 2 tbsp of cold butter to pan. Add raw shrimp to skillet as well, stir well and season with salt & pepper.<br><br>9. Transfer drained pasta and mixture in skillet into large pot together. Place over medium low heat and stir gently but often until shrimp are evenly pink on all sides and have begun to curl up a bit. Remove from heat, grate aged cheddar generously over the pasta, stir. Serve while hot with garlic bread or caesar salad.</h6>
