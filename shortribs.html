  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <h6>*** This recipe is easily scaled up or down. Try with 2, 4, 8 or even more short ribs! ***<br>4 large bone-in beef shortribs<br>3 large carrots, peeled<br>1 large yellow onions<br>2 stalks celery<br>2 cups beef stock<br>8 cloves garlic, peeled<br>1 cup dry red wine<br>2 tbsp tomato paste<br>Sumac<br>Sea Salt<br>Freshly cracked black pepper<br>Crushed Red Pepper</h6>
  <h3>Equipment</h3>
  <h6>Sous Vide Device<br>Large Pot/Stockpot<br>Sous Vide Bags (Vaccum bags or heavy duty zip bags work as well)<br>Aluminum Foil<br>Saucepan<br>Rubber Spatula<br>Large Frying Pan</h6>
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <h6>1. In a large frying pan, place as many of your short-ribs as will fit without crowding. Place the pan over medium heat and brown short ribs on all four sides. Ensure thorough seasoning with salt and pepper. If necessary, brown short ribs in several batches. Remove from pan and place to the side.<br><br>2. In a small saucepan, place beefstock over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat a bit and allow to simmer rapidly until reduced by one half.<br><br>3. Dice carrots, onion, and celery into 1/4 inch pieces. Add to remaining beef drippings in pan over medium heat. Season with salt and pepper and allow to cook until onions are translucent and the carrots begin to soften. Slice garlic cloves and add to the mixture. Pour in wine, reduced beef stock and tomato paste. Stir well until incorporated and remove from heat.<br><br>4. Set sous vide to 167ยบ. In sous vide bags, add short ribs and use a spoon or ladel to carefully add vegeetable mixture to the bag. Sprinkle about a tbsp of sumac and a tsp of crushed red pepper into the bag and close.<br><br>5. Cover the water bath with aluminum foil to prevent excess evaporation. Allow beef to cook for 30-35 hours. Sous vide allows for a wide range of cooking times and the beef short rib is rich in both fat and connective tissue that prevent over-cooking.<br><br>6. Prior to service, open sous vide bag and carefully remove short ribs. They will fall off the bone if pulled in the wrong direction. Add sauce and vegetables to a saucepan and bring to a boil. Allow to reduce, stirring often, for about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and pour off any excess fat that has collected on the surface. Serve short rib over a mashed starch and top with reduced vegetable sauce.</h6>
